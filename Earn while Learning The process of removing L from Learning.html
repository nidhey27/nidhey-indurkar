      <h3>Earn while Learning: The process of removing “L” from Learning!</h3>

      <!-- <p>This was a project I started back in november 2017 when I first learned python. I was the sole creator/developer for the first year of the project before I was able to hire help.
		<br>
		<br>
		The system stored fuel sample data for the entire lab and provided an interface for lab chemists and admins to view, add and send data to clients.
		<br>
		<br>
		Lab results would be generated by the system in PDF form and automatically sent to the client along with an interface for customers to be able to login and view.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to view all their data with a dynamic search form, trend data, add notes to reports and even map their samples' physical location.
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this system for 2 years before selling this to FOI Laboratories.</p> -->

      <li>
        <b>Learn to sell:</b> The phrase anticipates how to sell yourself. Oh!
        What I just said would sound disgusting, but it’s a fact. To be more
        precise, you need to sell (demonstrate) your skills to the interviewer
        if you want to earn the job. You have to sell your products to as many
        clients as you can to raise your profit. That means, to gain
        something, you need to sell something which belongs to you; it can be
        your skills, your work, your products, etc.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Choose Wisely:</b> You have to choose wisely what is good and what
        is bad for you. You should know how to figure out which steps would
        take you closer to your goals. In addition, look around your friend
        circle where you frequently spend time. Spend your time with level-up
        people. Spending your day with similar level people can never help you
        to improve. In fact, even if you try to grow in such surroundings,
        there is a probability that you will get dragged down by those people.
        In such cases, you will get to hear a phrases like “chodna yaar ye sab
        kya kar raha hai chill kartein hai”. Being closed to well-experienced
        people encourages you to learn more and explore your knowledge in a
        proper place. In short, I would like to shed some light on this famous
        quote, “If you are the smartest guy in the room, then you are in the
        wrong room”. This means you won’t be learning anything new when you
        are the only smartest in the room.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Sow the seeds of multiple income streams:</b> To become financially
        independent and wealthy simultaneously, you need to work for various
        income streams. You can’t be affluent by a single source of income.
        For example, you can start a side hustle, a small business, or you can
        do stock trading; invest in real estate apart from your job.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The habit that I practice a lot is “Positive Affirmations”. What is a positive affirmation? Basically, initiating
      or finishing your day by saying something good to yourself is positive affirmations. You would have seen lots of
      people talking with their image in a mirror and telling themselves that you’re awesome, you are great! And other
      pleasant phrases to themselves. This concept works and trains your mind to think that you are good enough or
      capable to achieve whatever you aspire. Now the most important thing for everybody is confidence. The moment you
      lose confidence, all three habits will be affected negatively. So positive affirmation is the best way to grow
      your confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly, you need to understand that Life is Hard. Okay, sometimes life can be very hard, hundered’s of bouncers
      will come your way. Then we can do two things – Either we get hit by a bouncer, sit back and cry, blame ourselves,
      other people or we can come back like Virat Kohli, put the helmet on, come back and hit a century. So either we
      can cry, or we can find the solution. When you get this kind of attitude, you get more confident. Who's gonna stop
      you from becoming successful? Nobody, but you.</p>
    </p>
    <p>And lastly, I would like to say imagine yourself in the next 5 years, Where do you see yourself in the next 5
      Years? What are your goals for the next 5 years? Just keep working for those goals and give your best. Think that
      I want to be in that position in the next five years. Even if you can't reach the goal don’t be disappointd
      because at least you have tried your best; so love the procedure and keep trying with determination. Just remember
      that whenever you face failure you get to learn new things from your mistakes. Learn from your mistakes. Things
      can go wrong, screw it and instead of crying try to find solution.</p>
    <p>And I would like to conclude by <i>“To baat aaysi hai ki, Har Jeet to Parinam hai, Par koshish krna to, humara kaam
      hai”</i></p> -->

      <p>
        For those unfamiliar people who do not know me, let me give you a brief
        introduction about myself. Then let us understand this concept
        step-by-step.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught programmer and have a bachelor’s degree in Computer
        Science and Engineering. My college never taught us how to code. They
        just taught us the syllabus-based academic portion, which was not enough
        to become a full-fledged software engineer or a web developer. Although,
        there were some meaningful subjects like TOC, CAO, DBMS, Design
        Patterns. The practical implementation was never the least crucial part
        of real-world programming, yet we could not learn much beyond the theory
        portion. As a result, there is a vast gap between college grads and
        industrial standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        After comprehending this situation, I started to explore the internet
        for the things like How to set off my career as a software engineer. I
        had commenced with C, C++, HTML, CSS, JS, and likely PHP. Then after
        learning these languages, I have created some mini projects and got an
        absolutely diverse experience. I was triggered to explore new bugs and
        errors while developing these mini-projects; thanks to Stack-overflow (a
        developer community), it helped me a lot! These mini-project experiences
        had left a great impression on me- so that is How things work out in
        programming, How real-world problems can be solved using technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Role of internships:</b>
        <br />
        Internships play a huge role if you are looking to earn while learning.
        After working on some projects, I’ve applied for several internships and
        landed my first internship at Take IT Ideas. When I have joined this
        company, I had a basic knowledge of Web Development and good
        problem-solving skills. But eventually, I started to learn advanced
        topics in PHP, AJAX, Jquery, Google Charts, and much more, also how to
        implement them in our project. The internship was unpaid, but Pratap
        Sir(the CEO/Founder of the company) had paid a small amount to the
        interns as a matter of appreciation. It was the moment when I realized
        that I could earn while learning. After completing the internship, I’d
        exposure to various technologies, industrial standards, and other stuff.
        So I initiated my career as a web developer, and now I’m a full-stack
        developer. Throughout the journey, I was working for someone as a
        freelancer or an intern, and simultaneously I was learning new things
        from my seniors. I had surfed the internet for the problems I was facing
        while executing the projects. I was learning from my mistake. While
        interning in Take IT Ideas, I felt like I wasn’t ready to work but,
        there were some people actually willing to hire me, and that’s what I
        want to let you know through this blog:

        <br /><br /><b
          >“You can get yourself to a certain point where other people are
          actually willing to hire you for the right job.”</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me tell you: I am not the only person to achieve this milestone, but
        some of my friends have landed a job that is paying them off for their
        work after implementing the concept of earning while learning. To be
        more precise, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhangi-hasoriya-bb0439171/">Shubhangi</a> has started as a UI designer, and now she is
        working as a Product Designer. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritwik-chavhan-0a6b85194/">Ritwik</a> has started with me as a web
        developer has now achieved the position of CTO. While <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aparna-sharma-5b78971b5/">Aparna</a>, who has
        started as a content writer and a recruiter, is currently editing books
        and is an HR associate. So the point is that anyone can do this by
        following the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Two things to be considered:</b><br />
        For a better understanding of the process, let's break it down into
        small steps; moreover, I will add some tips for the smooth
        implementation of each step.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <i>Concept of “Give and take”-</i>
          <p>
            Well, initially, it works because you are equipping value for
            others. Like in my case, I was working under somebody else, and I
            was capable enough to increase their efficiencies. They were getting
            a return on their investment by hiring me. They were training me
            according to the requirement of the company. They came across the
            fact that I could be autonomous. I learned how to figure out things
            where required, and that is how things work out step by step. So
            basically, you need to find a place where people are willing to
            spend time with you, to teach you what you are lagging, yet you have
            to keep learning on your own. As a result, you need to accomplish
            the given work and provide the values to the company; so that the
            company can furnish you with essential compensations and loads of
            experience.

          <i>Importance of market research-</i>
          <p>
            Now, many people could face confusion while choosing the right job
            for themselves. You might lack confidence while trying something
            new, and you would like to drop out of the job; where you are not
            comfortable. After getting a clear idea of your interest, you might
            think that you are not sure about the results; you take a step back
            and try to figure out solutions for this problem. So, being said,
            you need to learn more about the market to
            <i> “get your name out there”</i>
            and to apply for the jobs even if you think you aren’t ready. It
            sounds scary, but you need to come out of your comfort zone to see
            some unexpected outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start researching the market to know more about your interest,
            people’s interest, society’s interest, different domains, different
            products, market value, etc. Due to which you will become familiar
            with various job criteria, and you will start getting ready to earn.
            The market can show you whether you are set or not. For example, you
            need to start working to know if your work is acceptable or not.
            Even if you get a rejection, you can take it positively; because
            then you will know where exactly you need to work in order to make
            your skills valuable in your workspace. So basically, if you are
            going with the wrong mindset in the wrong direction, you may waste
            your precious time. If the market is pointing towards a particular
            direction like- “Hey, maybe you should focus on this(job/course).”
            So you can try and apply for it. But if you are still confused about
            choosing the course or a job, it’s reasonable; because obviously,
            you shouldn’t just put out applications for anything unfamiliar.
            Inquire more about such topics and start working on them as soon as
            you think it’s the right path.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
          <b>Implementation of the process: </b>
          <br>
          <i style="margin-left: 2rem;">Que: How to get ready for a job?</i>
            <br />
           <ul>
            <li>- Try working on these basic things:</li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><b>✔ Build your skills: </b>You need to do some tutorials, where you’re learning new things. For example, if you are a tech person, learn new technologies and project development. The primary way that I personally follow.</p>
            </li>
            <li>  
                <p><b>✔ Start practicing: </b>“Practice makes the man perfect.” To get the desired outcomes, you need to practice your learnings thoroughly. So, I highly recommend completing the given exercises or projects demonstrated in the tutorials. The next goal should be working on new projects without anyone’s help and try figuring out the solutions on your own.</p>
            </li>
            <li>  
                <p><b>✔ Portfolio matters: </b>Show your works and projects through a well-organized portfolio. The portfolio represents your working and problem-solving capability. Since the first thing an employer will do before a face-to-face interview is evaluate your portfolios or resumes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>  
                <p><b>✔ Stand out: </b>To become perfect in a field, you need to specialize in at least one skill. Specializing is really important because if you are getting paid, you need to be good enough in one area where someone’s willing to pay you, and then you can learn everything you need to know around that.</p>
            </li>
           </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have all these things, start applying for the jobs. You might face some rejections in the early stage, but that will manifest the areas where you need to work. Remember, we are the best teacher for ourselves, and learning from our mistakes is the best lesson.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s a lot of what I had done at the beginning of the journey. Initially, I specialized in back-end development. I barely knew front-end development. The only thing that helped me was polishing my only skill to get highlighted in the crowd. After getting hired, I eventually learned everything to reach my position requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b>Summarized tips: (FCE)</b>
          <br>
          <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Find</b> the right job for yourself; this might not work for everyone since it’s hard to recognize your interest, but that’s fine. Explore the internet as much as you can to find your interested field. Once you got your fascinated area of working, start discovering the jobs or employers who are willing to welcome you irrespective of your educational background and work experience; yet are interested or are amazed by your skills. 
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <b>Create</b> systematic strategies instead of just desiring outstanding results. If you are assuming to work in a well-known company that pays you a lump sum salary in the early stage of your career, then mister’ stop dreaming and wake up. <i>“Success is never accidental” – Jack Dorsey</i>. In fact, try finding an employer where you could get to learn something new. Think about it if you get a superior who is an expert in his working area with lots of knowledge, skills, and experience, you will get a chance to work and be trained under such person. Moreover, this is how you will get paid for learning with helpful proficiency.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                <b>Eliminate</b> the worries regarding the earning amount, at least at the beginning of your vocation. Initially, the most important thing is to get hired by a company regardless of the salary they are providing. If you are looking forward to learning while earning, you might need to work for a smaller amount. While commencing your career with the ‘earn while learning’ thing, your salary transaction might not match your expectations, but eventually, it will get upgraded as you move forward. Bear in mind that the initial working experience is to earn knowledge rather than money.
              </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, 
        <ul>
                <li>-	Master your skills and get specialized in them. </li>
                <li>-	Practice your skills and work on different projects. </li>
                <li>-	Decorate your portfolio with your various works and projects.</li>
                <li>-	Search for an employer who can guide you throughout your journey.</li>
