        <h3>An Escape: From your Misery Inclination</h3>

        <!-- <p>This was a project I started back in november 2017 when I first learned python. I was the sole creator/developer for the first year of the project before I was able to hire help.
		<br>
		<br>
		The system stored fuel sample data for the entire lab and provided an interface for lab chemists and admins to view, add and send data to clients.
		<br>
		<br>
		Lab results would be generated by the system in PDF form and automatically sent to the client along with an interface for customers to be able to login and view.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to view all their data with a dynamic search form, trend data, add notes to reports and even map their samples' physical location.
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this system for 2 years before selling this to FOI Laboratories.</p> -->

        <!-- <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Learn to sell:</b> The phrase anticipates how to sell yourself. Oh!
        What I just said would sound disgusting, but it’s a fact. To be more
        precise, you need to sell (demonstrate) your skills to the interviewer
        if you want to earn the job. You have to sell your products to as many
        clients as you can to raise your profit. That means, to gain
        something, you need to sell something which belongs to you; it can be
        your skills, your work, your products, etc.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Choose Wisely:</b> You have to choose wisely what is good and what
        is bad for you. You should know how to figure out which steps would
        take you closer to your goals. In addition, look around your friend
        circle where you frequently spend time. Spend your time with level-up
        people. Spending your day with similar level people can never help you
        to improve. In fact, even if you try to grow in such surroundings,
        there is a probability that you will get dragged down by those people.
        In such cases, you will get to hear a phrases like “chodna yaar ye sab
        kya kar raha hai chill kartein hai”. Being closed to well-experienced
        people encourages you to learn more and explore your knowledge in a
        proper place. In short, I would like to shed some light on this famous
        quote, “If you are the smartest guy in the room, then you are in the
        wrong room”. This means you won’t be learning anything new when you
        are the only smartest in the room.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Sow the seeds of multiple income streams:</b> To become financially
        independent and wealthy simultaneously, you need to work for various
        income streams. You can’t be affluent by a single source of income.
        For example, you can start a side hustle, a small business, or you can
        do stock trading; invest in real estate apart from your job.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The habit that I practice a lot is “Positive Affirmations”. What is a positive affirmation? Basically, initiating
      or finishing your day by saying something good to yourself is positive affirmations. You would have seen lots of
      people talking with their image in a mirror and telling themselves that you’re awesome, you are great! And other
      pleasant phrases to themselves. This concept works and trains your mind to think that you are good enough or
      capable to achieve whatever you aspire. Now the most important thing for everybody is confidence. The moment you
      lose confidence, all three habits will be affected negatively. So positive affirmation is the best way to grow
      your confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly, you need to understand that Life is Hard. Okay, sometimes life can be very hard, hundered’s of bouncers
      will come your way. Then we can do two things – Either we get hit by a bouncer, sit back and cry, blame ourselves,
      other people or we can come back like Virat Kohli, put the helmet on, come back and hit a century. So either we
      can cry, or we can find the solution. When you get this kind of attitude, you get more confident. Who's gonna stop
      you from becoming successful? Nobody, but you.</p>
    </p>
    <p>And lastly, I would like to say imagine yourself in the next 5 years, Where do you see yourself in the next 5
      Years? What are your goals for the next 5 years? Just keep working for those goals and give your best. Think that
      I want to be in that position in the next five years. Even if you can't reach the goal don’t be disappointd
      because at least you have tried your best; so love the procedure and keep trying with determination. Just remember
      that whenever you face failure you get to learn new things from your mistakes. Learn from your mistakes. Things
      can go wrong, screw it and instead of crying try to find solution.</p>
    <p>And I would like to conclude by <i>“To baat aaysi hai ki, Har Jeet to Parinam hai, Par koshish krna to, humara kaam
      hai”</i></p> -->

            The title speaks for itself, an escape yes you are right. 
What clicks in your mind when you hear the word escape. 
A Hangout Or trip to some nice place without any weight on the mind maybe.
Just like that Any story Time either be bedtime stories or Grandma's tales was one such escape for us in our childhood.I bet you all have listened and read about the stories of moral values/lessons either at school or home.I can hear someone saying still listing! Hahaha, jokes apart. With one such story, I'm here today to take you back to those memories which might change your thoughts again.

            <br><br>
            <i>So, the story goes like this</i> -
        </p>

        <div>
            <p style="font-weight: 900;">***</p>
            <p>Once upon a time, there lives a monk in a small village with his two disciples. One fine day the monk
                took his disciples to take an evening walk through the village. In a while, they reach the marketplace
                of
                the village. In the middle of the market's hubbub, they saw a man dragging a cow that was tied by a
                rope. The man was trying to take his cow back home, but the cow, who was unwilling to go back, was
                stubbornly pulling off the string against the man. The man kept struggling for long time, but the cow
                didn't move an inch. The monk then asked his disciples to observe the site and let's learn something
                new from this situation. The monk continued questioning his disciples,
                <br><br>
                <i>“What do you think, who is controlling whom?”</i>
                <br><br>
                <i>
                    “Does the cow need this man, or does the man need the cow?”
                </i>
                <br><br>
                <i>“Differentiate the master, and the slave between them?”
                </i>
                <br><br>
                Without any hesitation, one of the disciples answered -
                <br><br>
                <i>“Isn’t it obvious already?”</i>
                <br><br>
                <i>“Of course, the cow is controlled by the man!”</i>
                <br><br>
                By elongating the answer, the disciple explains-
                <br><br>
                <i>“Since the man possesses the rope that ties the cow, the cow has no other option but to follow her
                    owner.”</i>
                <br><br>
                <i>“The man is the master, and the cow is the slave.”</i>

                <br><br>
                The monk smiled and asked again-
                <br><br>
                <i>“Are you sure about your answer?”</i>
                <br><br>
                The disciple replied with an uncertain tone-
                <br>
            <p>“~Yes..”</p>
            

            </p>
            <p>The monk encouragingly said-
                <br><br>
                <i>“Seems like to make the fact visible; I need to clean the dust from the window.”</i>
                <br><br>
                The monk took a scissor from his bag and cut down the rope. The moment he cuts the rope cow runs
away. The man screamed at the monk, “why did you do that?” and started running after the cow. Again
the monk questioned his disciples-
<br><br>
<i>“Now tell me, who is the master?”
</i>
<br><br>
The monk continued-
<br><br>
<i>“The cow doesn’t seem to be interested in serving that man. In fact, she was trying to escape from him.
    So, as we can see the instant the cow ran away, the man started following her even without any
    obligation of the rope.”</i>
    <br><br>
    <i>“Similarly, all the gibberish we bear in our head is not even fascinated by us; But, we ourselves get
        distracted by those emotions. We are treating them dearly and not letting them free from our minds. The
        moment you realize that all these ‘twaddle emotions’ are not even worth our attention and if you start
        avoiding these thoughts, you will discover that all the negativity will start evading from your mind.”
        </i>
        <br><br>
        The disciples got this beautiful lesson for the day, and then the monk and his disciples continued with
their evening walk.
            </p>

        </div>
        <p>If you can relate your life with this story’s moral, you might realize that our mind is in a parallel situation.
            Sometimes we live in a delusion that we are the owner of our thoughts, which is perhaps mistaken;
            because we tend to become servants when these negative thoughts begin behaving like an owner. It
            happens because we gave them needless importance also, we ourselves, empowering our negative
            thoughts to imprison our mind. Although just like that cow, this negativity is ready to escape our minds
            once it is out of surveillance. We still let this negativity create a shelf in our minds and keep pressuring
            our minds to overthink about it. The instant we start ignoring these gibberishes, it will escape from our
            minds just like that cow.
            </p>
            <p><b>Hence, keep in mind that releasing stress and feeling relaxed is a choice and not the principle. So, why
                not choose something that is in our favor. Let’s enjoy our life with an optimistic path. </b></p>
