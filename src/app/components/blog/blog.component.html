                <h6>How Spending More Time in the Terminal Can Transform Your Software
                    Engineering Career
                </h6>
                <p>
                    The terminal, also known as the command line interface (CLI), is a powerful tool for software
                    engineers that can help them perform a wide range of tasks more efficiently and effectively.
                    While many developers may be more comfortable using graphical user interfaces (GUIs), learning
                    how to use the terminal can provide significant benefits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the key advantages of using the terminal is that it can help developers better understand
                    the underlying processes that are happening in their code. When using a GUI, developers may not
                    have as clear a view of what's happening behind the scenes, which can make it harder to diagnose
                    and fix issues. The terminal, on the other hand, provides a direct view into the command-line
                    interface of the operating system, which can help developers better understand how their code
                    interacts with the system and identify potential issues more quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, learning how to use basic terminal commands can help software engineers streamline
                    their workflow and perform tasks more quickly and efficiently. For example, rather than
                    navigating through a series of menus in a GUI, developers can use command-line shortcuts to
                    quickly navigate to the directories they need or perform complex operations with a single
                    command.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another advantage of using the terminal is that it can help software engineers work more
                    effectively with remote servers or cloud-based infrastructure. Many cloud providers offer
                    command-line interfaces that allow developers to manage their infrastructure from the terminal,
                    which can be more efficient and secure than using a GUI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, by exploring new tools and techniques for using the terminal, software engineers can
                    stay ahead of the curve and find new ways to optimize their workflows. There are many resources
                    available online for learning more about the terminal and how to use it effectively, including
                    tutorials, videos, and online communities.

    <h3>Can Money afford Happiness?</h3>



    <p>
        Hey guys! In this blog, I would like to talk about the significant connection between happiness and
        money. How many of you think that happiness cannot survive without money? Perhaps a few of the
        readers think money was never an essential factor for the existence of happiness, am I right? Yet, I
        would say in my opinion, Happiness and Money are two sides of our life without which it's difficult to
        imagine our life. As we move toward modernization, money's worth increases drastically in nature; You
        might have heard one key phrase in today's world <u><i>“Everything comes with a price!”</i></u>.



    </p>

    <div>
        <b>So, Can happiness also have a price tag?</b>
        <br>
        <b>Can we Buy Happiness with Money?</b>

        <p>When you look at the headline, don't these questions cross your mind? So let's try answering these
            questions by simply noticing the general happenings in our surroundings in different environments…
        </p>

        <p>
            The basic question that arises throughout the topic would be <i><b>“CAN MONEY BUY HAPPINESS?”</b></i>
            The
            answer to this question will differ from person to person. If you ask those with excess money, they
            would say, "Yes, you can buy happiness with money". On the same note if you ask poverty-stricken
            people, they might behave as if money was never an issue in life, to begin with. It's just you need to
            know how to be satisfied with what's given. Their statements would be like - <i>
                “Yeah sab moh Maya hai,
                Paiso se khushiya nahi kharidi ja sakti… Khushiya pyaar se milti hai, Khushiya pariwar se milti hai…
                and
                so
                on.”
            </i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i><b>“Whoever said money can't buy happiness simply didn't know where to go shopping.”--Gertrude
                    stein</b></i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Exactly, people who say that money can't buy happiness have apparently never used any! What is the
            point of lying about being satisfied, while struggling to earn money to fulfill the necessities of your
            family? Can you be happy if your child is hungry, or if you are in debt? Of course not! This proves that
            money and happiness are interconnected with each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nowadays, the time has radically changed - people's average income has increased, and even ways to
            earn and spend money have amplified. As a result, we must learn today's generation's ways of earning
            and spending money. So that, we can live life to the fullest and use our well-earned money properly to
            accomplish our daily needs in every aspect of life.
        </p>

        <p>
            <i><b>“Money can buy the happiness, because the generation has been changed.” – <span
                        style="color: red">Unknown</span></b></i>
        </p>

            <h6>Money is the solution for any materialistic issues -</h6>
            <p><i><u>Money can solve the different problems in your life…</u></i></p>
            <p>
                For a commoner, what are the basic issues in everyday life?
            </p>
            <p>
                If only we could buy a decent sized house in a pleasant area for the family. If only we could afford
                a car
                for daily transportation. If only I could get admission to a reputed college. If only I could have a
                lump
                sum amount of money to start my own business, and so on… That is, if we observe these situations
                closely, the common problems of life are money-related. For instance, I want to buy a house; if I
                have
                the finances, I can buy a luxurious villa or bungalow at any location I prefer, such as the
                seafront.
                Regardless of how expensive a specialist's services are, I could have afforded to receive proper
                treatment for any illness. If you have funds, you can establish your own business or you can study
                at any
                eminent institute. Overall, many of the problems in our life can be solved with money.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>✔ Purpose of Wealth:</b>
                It is common to experience momentary happiness when we think of having money, like being on
                vacation, having an iPhone, paying for a BMW, etc. Moreover, if you explore the deepest
                possibilities of
                money, you will realize that money can give you all the ‘THINGS' that can make you happy. The thing
                is
                money can help you achieve Freedom, Security, Healthy relationships, Better education, and a Bright
                Future. If we summarize, <i>the basic purpose of Wealth is to improve our Living Standards.</i>
            </p>
            <p>Okay, to get a better grasp of my ideas, let us practice a simple simulation: Just imagine that you
                are
                having a luxurious life, you are wearing expensive clothes, your child is studying at renowned
                universities, and you can daily have healthy meals four times a day. How do you feel now? Wow feels
                good, right? Okay, now assume that you came into reality. You belong to a poor family, where a roof
                and clothes are out of the question, since you cannot even afford two times the bread. Woof, quite
                scary! Now, you ask yourself- “Which life would you prefer?”</p>

            <b><i>“Money can't buy happiness but it can buy you the misery you prefer.” –Groucho Marx</i></b>
        </div>

        <p>
            <i><u>Money makes life easier;</u></i> In an easy life, it becomes easier to achieve a state of
            happiness. When you
            don't have to worry about your basic needs, then you can explore many different aspects of life like
            learning, reading, spirituality, and many more things which establishes peace in your subconscious mind
            by reducing the stress from your daily life. Maybe you wouldn't have noticed it, <i><u>but money can
                    also give
                    us extra time.</u></i> Having extra time means we have time to improve ourselves by working on
            ourselves or
            to enjoy our hobbies.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>✔ Money aids to build a healthy mental system:</b>
            Even though you have paid the EMI for 5 years, you still need to pay more for the next 5 years to
            complete the full payment of your 3 BHK flat. Along with that, you have to pay your children's academic
            fees and their general expenses from your salary each month. Additionally, being in a joint family
            (which
            is common in Asian culture) you need to take care of your parents' meditations and other medical or
            health-related equipment. Is it possible to have all this going on in your life and not feel stressed?
            What
            is the probability of that person enjoying his life? Are you sure that he/she is ok with not getting to
            spend some free time for himself/herself or his/her family and friends?
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, having enough money in our pocket decreases most of the stress-threatening factors in our life.
            If money can solve most of the problems and can free us from a stress full life, we can assume that
            money does help us to be happy. Some people are struggling to earn enough to cover their daily
            expenses, while others are still stressing out about how they can earn a bigger amount of money or how
            they can expand their businesses to boost their income source, although they already have enough
            money. This is called being greedy. One should always feel grateful if one can afford a comfortable
            life. If
            it is challenging, think about those who can't even afford a fan for the summer season, or how tough it
            could be to sleep on a mattress without having a blanket to resist the cold breezes in winter, or maybe
            the floating house in rainy days could do.

        </p>

        <p>
            <i><u>You can buy comfort with money.</u></i> Take an example of cars like BMW, Audi, and Rolls Royce,
            they charge
            you for comfort. Being comfortable could be less stressful.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i><u>Money gives you the steering of your life in your hands.</u></i> If you want to travel to another
            city urgently and
            if you have enough money, you can book a plane. Even if the plane isn't available for whatever reason,
            you can book a cab and you can arrive at the destination. <i><u> Money opens multiple doors for
                    you.</u></i>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i><b>“If money can't buy happiness, then I guess I'll have to rent it.”— <span
                        style="color: red">Unknown</span></b></i>
        </p>

        <div>
            <h6>Happiness is a state of mind, is it? </h6>

            <p>
                <i><u>Money-related tension can fill a calm person with stress and despair.</u></i> That's why money
                is necessary for
                a stress-free and calm mind. In an interview, Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan once said- <b><i> “Don't
                        become a
                        philosopher before you become rich!”.</i></b>
            </p>

            <p>As said, happiness is a state of mind. I agree - being happy is entirely up to you. But this state
                comes only
                after stability; stability of being employed or having a business, stability of having a proper
                house to stay
                in, stability of your children getting a proper education, and stability of fulfilling daily
                necessities. For all
                this, one should be “CAPABLE ENOUGH WITH MONEY” to bring themselves to a state of stability.</p>

            <p>
                ✔ Diversity of Pleasure and Happiness:

                So when you get an appraisal at work, or if your child has spoken his/her first word, or your
                dearest
                younger sister got her first salary, or you get the news that one of your closest friends is getting
                married,
                or maybe your elder brother is going to become a dad in a few months, how would you feel? Sounds
                thrilling, right? This short-lived happiness is known as Momentary happiness. Momentary happiness is
                an emotion of pleasure. Then, what is long-term happiness? The condition of sustained happiness
                means the state of happiness. Like having healthy relationships, pursuing your dream career,
                accomplishing the biggest goal in your life, or getting to learn about the reasons for your
                existence, etc.
                It is very important to analyze the difference between pleasure and happiness so that we can
                understand what the limitations of pecuniary (monetary) happiness are.

            </p>
            <p>
                Many people get confused between pleasure and happiness and think that both are the same. However,
                pleasure is external and happiness is internal. Pleasure can be achieved with a substance while
                happiness cannot be achieved with any substance. Happiness is different from pleasure in some ways,
                even though it seems similar. Money can be of much help to those who are looking for pleasure but
                there are some drawbacks to pleasure. Pleasure is time-limited. Pleasure often does not last long,
                since
                attention quickly moves to other matters. The feeling of being happy fades, when the individual is
                unable to access the resource or the interest in the resource ends or their attention is
                diverted. Sometimes, too much of something stops being enjoyable. That's why people who use money
                for pleasure, at a certain point, think that money can't bring happiness. The extremes of pleasure
                lead to
                addiction, whether to a substance or behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Money can bring you both happiness and pleasure at the same time, how? If you have money, society
                will compliment you, respect you and give attention to you whereas when you don't have any money,
                your social value becomes NIL. They say people always salute the rising sun, and not the setting
                one, but
                how long will this pretentious respect and appreciation keep you happy??
            </p>
            <p>
                If you spend on experiences, then experiences become part of your memories. Your memories of those
                experiences make you happy whenever you recall them. So if you want your happiness to last for a
                longer duration or period then fill your memory bank with such experiences, which will keep you
                happy.
                We do a huge mistake by buying/spending on those materialistic things like iPhones, expensive
                clothes,
                etc which give us momentary pleasure whereas we don't realize the importance of
                experience. <i><u>Experiences make your life meaningful, while materialistic things give you
                        momentary
                        happiness.</u></i>
            </p>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h6>Money helps you to make others happy.</h6>

            <p>
                <i><u>Money also helps you to make others smile.</u></i> If your child wants to buy toys or you want
                to buy a gift for
                your partner or parents, or even if you want to treat a beggar, everything requires money.
                Therefore, in
                order to keep your loved ones happy, to help the needy, or to do any sort of social work, you need
                money. When the people involved are satisfied, you also get content. It is scientifically proven
                that by
                making others happy, you get some frequency waves generated in your brain due to which you get
                satisfaction and achieve inner happiness. If you can't believe it, try to help a needy poor person,
                or
                anyone. Nevertheless, you can only aid them when you have enough money. If your needs are higher
                than your income then you won't be able to help others, and if anyhow you manage to help others then
                you need to lower your desires which will lead to a decrease in self-happiness.

            </p>

            <small><i>In this case, both prerequisites are relevant: To give someone something, we need money (which
                    is a materialistic
                    act) and to give them a good life, we feel happy (therefore, it is a state of
                    mind)</i></small><br>

            <b><i>“They say money can't buy happiness, darling! But it does allow you to give it away!”
                    –Freddie Mercury</i></b>
        </div>


        <div>
            <h6>Wrapping up</h6>
            <p>
                In conclusion, most of life's materialistic problems can be solved by money.. Still, it is
                ultimately up to us
                to do what we can to make ourselves happy. Let's all do our very best to satisfy our desires and
                bring
                that stability to our lives. You do not need money to live a happy life, but instead of waiting for
                the
                "RIGHT" opportunity, you should always be open to learning and trying various things to adapt to the
                current technological era. Instead of blaming money or forming the theory that money can't buy
                happiness, think progressively, take actions, and develop a magnetic personality. This will attract
                both
                money and happiness to you. Rather than chasing happiness and money, you must develop your worth
                so that you can incorporate everything into leading a happy life. So this was my point of view on
                Can
                money buy happiness? What's your view? Let me know at my social media handle

    <h3>The 3 Habits: “Foundation of Success”</h3>

    <!-- <p>This was a project I started back in november 2017 when I first learned python. I was the sole creator/developer for the first year of the project before I was able to hire help.
		<br>
		<br>
		The system stored fuel sample data for the entire lab and provided an interface for lab chemists and admins to view, add and send data to clients.
		<br>
		<br>
		Lab results would be generated by the system in PDF form and automatically sent to the client along with an interface for customers to be able to login and view.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to view all their data with a dynamic search form, trend data, add notes to reports and even map their samples' physical location.
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this system for 2 years before selling this to FOI Laboratories.</p> -->

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Learn to sell:</b> The phrase anticipates how to sell yourself. Oh!
            What I just said would sound disgusting, but it’s a fact. To be more
            precise, you need to sell (demonstrate) your skills to the interviewer
            if you want to earn the job. You have to sell your products to as many
            clients as you can to raise your profit. That means, to gain
            something, you need to sell something which belongs to you; it can be
            your skills, your work, your products, etc.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Choose Wisely:</b> You have to choose wisely what is good and what
            is bad for you. You should know how to figure out which steps would
            take you closer to your goals. In addition, look around your friend
            circle where you frequently spend time. Spend your time with level-up
            people. Spending your day with similar level people can never help you
            to improve. In fact, even if you try to grow in such surroundings,
            there is a probability that you will get dragged down by those people.
            In such cases, you will get to hear a phrases like “chodna yaar ye sab
            kya kar raha hai chill kartein hai”. Being closed to well-experienced
            people encourages you to learn more and explore your knowledge in a
            proper place. In short, I would like to shed some light on this famous
            quote, “If you are the smartest guy in the room, then you are in the
            wrong room”. This means you won’t be learning anything new when you
            are the only smartest in the room.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Sow the seeds of multiple income streams:</b> To become financially
            independent and wealthy simultaneously, you need to work for various
            income streams. You can’t be affluent by a single source of income.
            For example, you can start a side hustle, a small business, or you can
            do stock trading; invest in real estate apart from your job.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The habit that I practice a lot is “Positive Affirmations”. What is a positive affirmation? Basically,
        initiating
        or finishing your day by saying something good to yourself is positive affirmations. You would have seen lots of
        people talking with their image in a mirror and telling themselves that you’re awesome, you are great! And other
        pleasant phrases to themselves. This concept works and trains your mind to think that you are good enough or
        capable to achieve whatever you aspire. Now the most important thing for everybody is confidence. The moment you
        lose confidence, all three habits will be affected negatively. So positive affirmation is the best way to grow
        your confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly, you need to understand that Life is Hard. Okay, sometimes life can be very hard, hundered’s of bouncers
        will come your way. Then we can do two things – Either we get hit by a bouncer, sit back and cry, blame
        ourselves,
        other people or we can come back like Virat Kohli, put the helmet on, come back and hit a century. So either we
        can cry, or we can find the solution. When you get this kind of attitude, you get more confident. Who's gonna
        stop
        you from becoming successful? Nobody, but you.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>And lastly, I would like to say imagine yourself in the next 5 years, Where do you see yourself in the next 5
        Years? What are your goals for the next 5 years? Just keep working for those goals and give your best. Think
        that
        I want to be in that position in the next five years. Even if you can't reach the goal don’t be disappointd
        because at least you have tried your best; so love the procedure and keep trying with determination. Just
        remember
        that whenever you face failure you get to learn new things from your mistakes. Learn from your mistakes. Things
        can go wrong, screw it and instead of crying try to find solution.</p>
    <p>And I would like to conclude by <i>“To baat aaysi hai ki, Har Jeet to Parinam hai, Par koshish krna to, humara
            kaam
            hai”</i></p>

    <h3>Earn while Learning: The process of removing “L” from Learning!</h3>

    <p>
        For those unfamiliar people who do not know me, let me give you a brief
        introduction about myself. Then let us understand this concept
        step-by-step.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a self-taught programmer and have a bachelor’s degree in Computer
        Science and Engineering. My college never taught us how to code. They
        just taught us the syllabus-based academic portion, which was not enough
        to become a full-fledged software engineer or a web developer. Although,
        there were some meaningful subjects like TOC, CAO, DBMS, Design
        Patterns. The practical implementation was never the least crucial part
        of real-world programming, yet we could not learn much beyond the theory
        portion. As a result, there is a vast gap between college grads and
        industrial standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        After comprehending this situation, I started to explore the internet
        for the things like How to set off my career as a software engineer. I
        had commenced with C, C++, HTML, CSS, JS, and likely PHP. Then after
        learning these languages, I have created some mini projects and got an
        absolutely diverse experience. I was triggered to explore new bugs and
        errors while developing these mini-projects; thanks to Stack-overflow (a
        developer community), it helped me a lot! These mini-project experiences
        had left a great impression on me- so that is How things work out in
        programming, How real-world problems can be solved using technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Role of internships:</b>
        <br>
        Internships play a huge role if you are looking to earn while learning.
        After working on some projects, I’ve applied for several internships and
        landed my first internship at Take IT Ideas. When I have joined this
        company, I had a basic knowledge of Web Development and good
        problem-solving skills. But eventually, I started to learn advanced
        topics in PHP, AJAX, Jquery, Google Charts, and much more, also how to
        implement them in our project. The internship was unpaid, but Pratap
        Sir(the CEO/Founder of the company) had paid a small amount to the
        interns as a matter of appreciation. It was the moment when I realized
        that I could earn while learning. After completing the internship, I’d
        exposure to various technologies, industrial standards, and other stuff.
        So I initiated my career as a web developer, and now I’m a full-stack
        developer. Throughout the journey, I was working for someone as a
        freelancer or an intern, and simultaneously I was learning new things
        from my seniors. I had surfed the internet for the problems I was facing
        while executing the projects. I was learning from my mistake. While
        interning in Take IT Ideas, I felt like I wasn’t ready to work but,
        there were some people actually willing to hire me, and that’s what I
        want to let you know through this blog:

        <br><br><b>“You can get yourself to a certain point where other people are
            actually willing to hire you for the right job.”</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Let me tell you: I am not the only person to achieve this milestone, but
        some of my friends have landed a job that is paying them off for their
        work after implementing the concept of earning while learning. To be
        more precise, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubhangi-hasoriya-bb0439171/">Shubhangi</a> has started as a
        UI designer, and now she is
        working as a Product Designer. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ritwik-chavhan-0a6b85194/">Ritwik</a> has
        started with me as a web
        developer has now achieved the position of CTO. While <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aparna-sharma-5b78971b5/">Aparna</a>, who has
        started as a content writer and a recruiter, is currently editing books
        and is an HR associate. So the point is that anyone can do this by
        following the process.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Two things to be considered:</b><br>
        For a better understanding of the process, let's break it down into
        small steps; moreover, I will add some tips for the smooth
        implementation of each step.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <i>Concept of “Give and take”-</i>
            <p>
                Well, initially, it works because you are equipping value for
                others. Like in my case, I was working under somebody else, and I
                was capable enough to increase their efficiencies. They were getting
                a return on their investment by hiring me. They were training me
                according to the requirement of the company. They came across the
                fact that I could be autonomous. I learned how to figure out things
                where required, and that is how things work out step by step. So
                basically, you need to find a place where people are willing to
                spend time with you, to teach you what you are lagging, yet you have
                to keep learning on your own. As a result, you need to accomplish
                the given work and provide the values to the company; so that the
                company can furnish you with essential compensations and loads of
                experience.
                <br><br>
                <b>
                    "Learn and explore the new things that come across your journey;
                    if life is trying to teach you something, then take a grasp of it
                    and enjoy".
                </b>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <i>Importance of market research-</i>
            <p>
                Now, many people could face confusion while choosing the right job
                for themselves. You might lack confidence while trying something
                new, and you would like to drop out of the job; where you are not
                comfortable. After getting a clear idea of your interest, you might
                think that you are not sure about the results; you take a step back
                and try to figure out solutions for this problem. So, being said,
                you need to learn more about the market to
                <i> “get your name out there”</i>
                and to apply for the jobs even if you think you aren’t ready. It
                sounds scary, but you need to come out of your comfort zone to see
                some unexpected outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start researching the market to know more about your interest,
                people’s interest, society’s interest, different domains, different
                products, market value, etc. Due to which you will become familiar
                with various job criteria, and you will start getting ready to earn.
                The market can show you whether you are set or not. For example, you
                need to start working to know if your work is acceptable or not.
                Even if you get a rejection, you can take it positively; because
                then you will know where exactly you need to work in order to make
                your skills valuable in your workspace. So basically, if you are
                going with the wrong mindset in the wrong direction, you may waste
                your precious time. If the market is pointing towards a particular
                direction like- “Hey, maybe you should focus on this(job/course).”
                So you can try and apply for it. But if you are still confused about
                choosing the course or a job, it’s reasonable; because obviously,
                you shouldn’t just put out applications for anything unfamiliar.
                Inquire more about such topics and start working on them as soon as
                you think it’s the right path.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <b>Implementation of the process: </b>
        <br>
        <i style="margin-left: 2rem;">Que: How to get ready for a job?</i>
        <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Try working on these basic things:</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <p><b>✔ Build your skills: </b>You need to do some tutorials, where you’re learning new things. For example,
                if you are a tech person, learn new technologies and project development. The primary way that I
                personally follow.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>✔ Start practicing: </b>“Practice makes the man perfect.” To get the desired outcomes, you need to
                practice your learnings thoroughly. So, I highly recommend completing the given exercises or projects
                demonstrated in the tutorials. The next goal should be working on new projects without anyone’s help and
                try figuring out the solutions on your own.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>✔ Portfolio matters: </b>Show your works and projects through a well-organized portfolio. The
                portfolio represents your working and problem-solving capability. Since the first thing an employer will
                do before a face-to-face interview is evaluate your portfolios or resumes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>✔ Stand out: </b>To become perfect in a field, you need to specialize in at least one skill.
                Specializing is really important because if you are getting paid, you need to be good enough in one area
                where someone’s willing to pay you, and then you can learn everything you need to know around that.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        Once you have all these things, start applying for the jobs. You might face some rejections in the early stage,
        but that will manifest the areas where you need to work. Remember, we are the best teacher for ourselves, and
        learning from our mistakes is the best lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
        That’s a lot of what I had done at the beginning of the journey. Initially, I specialized in back-end
        development. I barely knew front-end development. The only thing that helped me was polishing my only skill to
        get highlighted in the crowd. After getting hired, I eventually learned everything to reach my position
        requirement.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Summarized tips: (FCE)</b>
        <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Find</b> the right job for yourself; this might not work for everyone since it’s hard to recognize your
            interest, but that’s fine. Explore the internet as much as you can to find your interested field. Once you
            got your fascinated area of working, start discovering the jobs or employers who are willing to welcome you
            irrespective of your educational background and work experience; yet are interested or are amazed by your
            skills.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Create</b> systematic strategies instead of just desiring outstanding results. If you are assuming to
            work in a well-known company that pays you a lump sum salary in the early stage of your career, then mister’
            stop dreaming and wake up. <i>“Success is never accidental” – Jack Dorsey</i>. In fact, try finding an
            employer where you could get to learn something new. Think about it if you get a superior who is an expert
            in his working area with lots of knowledge, skills, and experience, you will get a chance to work and be
            trained under such person. Moreover, this is how you will get paid for learning with helpful proficiency.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b>Eliminate</b> the worries regarding the earning amount, at least at the beginning of your vocation.
            Initially, the most important thing is to get hired by a company regardless of the salary they are
            providing. If you are looking forward to learning while earning, you might need to work for a smaller
            amount. While commencing your career with the ‘earn while learning’ thing, your salary transaction might not
            match your expectations, but eventually, it will get upgraded as you move forward. Bear in mind that the
            initial working experience is to earn knowledge rather than money.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        In conclusion,
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Master your skills and get specialized in them. </li>
        <li>- Practice your skills and work on different projects. </li>
        <li>- Decorate your portfolio with your various works and projects.</li>
        <li>- Search for an employer who can guide you throughout your journey.</li>

    <h3>An Escape: From your Misery Inclination</h3>



    <p>
        The title speaks for itself, an escape yes you are right.
        What clicks in your mind when you hear the word escape.
        A Hangout Or trip to some nice place without any weight on the mind maybe.
        Just like that Any story Time either be bedtime stories or Grandma's tales was one such escape for us in our
        childhood.I bet you all have listened and read about the stories of moral values/lessons either at school or
        home.I can hear someone saying still listing! Hahaha, jokes apart. With one such story, I'm here today to take
        you back to those memories which might change your thoughts again.

        <br><br>
        <i>So, the story goes like this</i> -
    </p>

    <div>
        <p style="font-weight: 900;">***</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, there lives a monk in a small village with his two disciples. One fine day the monk
            took his disciples to take an evening walk through the village. In a while, they reach the marketplace
            of
            the village. In the middle of the market's hubbub, they saw a man dragging a cow that was tied by a
            rope. The man was trying to take his cow back home, but the cow, who was unwilling to go back, was
            stubbornly pulling off the string against the man. The man kept struggling for long time, but the cow
            didn't move an inch. The monk then asked his disciples to observe the site and let's learn something
            new from this situation. The monk continued questioning his disciples,
            <br><br>
            <i>“What do you think, who is controlling whom?”</i>
            <br><br>
            <i>
                “Does the cow need this man, or does the man need the cow?”
            </i>
            <br><br>
            <i>“Differentiate the master, and the slave between them?”
            </i>
            <br><br>
            Without any hesitation, one of the disciples answered -
            <br><br>
            <i>“Isn’t it obvious already?”</i>
            <br><br>
            <i>“Of course, the cow is controlled by the man!”</i>
            <br><br>
            By elongating the answer, the disciple explains-
            <br><br>
            <i>“Since the man possesses the rope that ties the cow, the cow has no other option but to follow her
                owner.”</i>
            <br><br>
            <i>“The man is the master, and the cow is the slave.”</i>

            <br><br>
            The monk smiled and asked again-
            <br><br>
            <i>“Are you sure about your answer?”</i>
            <br><br>
            The disciple replied with an uncertain tone-
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>“~Yes..”</p>


        <p></p>
        <p>The monk encouragingly said-
            <br><br>
            <i>“Seems like to make the fact visible; I need to clean the dust from the window.”</i>
            <br><br>
            The monk took a scissor from his bag and cut down the rope. The moment he cuts the rope cow runs
            away. The man screamed at the monk, “why did you do that?” and started running after the cow. Again
            the monk questioned his disciples-
            <br><br>
            <i>“Now tell me, who is the master?”
            </i>
            <br><br>
            The monk continued-
            <br><br>
            <i>“The cow doesn’t seem to be interested in serving that man. In fact, she was trying to escape from him.
                So, as we can see the instant the cow ran away, the man started following her even without any
                obligation of the rope.”</i>
            <br><br>
            <i>“Similarly, all the gibberish we bear in our head is not even fascinated by us; But, we ourselves get
                distracted by those emotions. We are treating them dearly and not letting them free from our minds. The
                moment you realize that all these ‘twaddle emotions’ are not even worth our attention and if you start
                avoiding these thoughts, you will discover that all the negativity will start evading from your mind.”
            </i>
            <br><br>
            The disciples got this beautiful lesson for the day, and then the monk and his disciples continued with
            their evening walk.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: 900;">***</p>


    </div>
    <p>If you can relate your life with this story’s moral, you might realize that our mind is in a parallel situation.
        Sometimes we live in a delusion that we are the owner of our thoughts, which is perhaps mistaken;
        because we tend to become servants when these negative thoughts begin behaving like an owner. It
        happens because we gave them needless importance also, we ourselves, empowering our negative
        thoughts to imprison our mind. Although just like that cow, this negativity is ready to escape our minds
        once it is out of surveillance. We still let this negativity create a shelf in our minds and keep pressuring
        our minds to overthink about it. The instant we start ignoring these gibberishes, it will escape from our
        minds just like that cow.
    </p>
    <p><b>Hence, keep in mind that releasing stress and feeling relaxed is a choice and not the principle. So, why
            not choose something that is in our favor. Let’s enjoy our life with an optimistic path. </b></p>

    <h3>Who decides what to live by? Why do people live by others' templates? Choosing unconventional ways of living
        might cause short-term discomfort, but following a template created by others would cause lasting
        discomfort.</h3>



    <p>
        This is one of my favorite dialogues &amp; the scene from the 3 Idiots Movie:
    </p>

    <div>
        <p>When Pia &amp; Rancho post a letter from Farhan to his favorite photographer as he wants to pursue Wildlife
            Photography and
        </p>

        <p>Farhan says – <b>“Abba nahi Manage!”</b></p>
        <p>
            Rancho replies – <b>“ Aaj dar mat Farhan, Jab tu budha hokar aayse hi kisi Haspatal me pada hoga aur
                marne ka intezar kar raha hoga, Tab sochega ki letter hath me tha, Taxi gate par thi, Thodi si
                Himmat kar leta to Jindagi kuch aur hoti. ”
            </b>

        </p>

        <p>
            Most of us have experienced this situation while we are making choices about our careers, marriage, etc.
            Society has developed a template for you –
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
                Just like things you need to accomplish in your 20’s – Complete education, Get a decent Job, Get
                Married, Buy a House, Have kids, and whatnot….

            </b>
        </p>

        <p>Walking on your own path could be uncomfortable and frightening.</p>
        <p><b><i>Guess what’s more scary?</i></b></p>
        <p>
            What’s even scarier is to walk on the path that everyone walks on <b><i>(The Rat Race)</i></b>; only to
            realize later
            that you wouldn’t have chosen that path.

        </p>

        <p>When Farhan goes to his father and tell him – <b>“ Abba mai Engineer nahi Ban na Chahta, muze wildlife
                photographer ban na hai” </b>
        </p>

        <p>What his father replies is – <b>“Kitna kama loge us jungle me, 5 saal bad jab aapne dosto ko badi badi
                gadio me ghumte dekhoge to kosoge khud ko, are hasege log…” </b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>The most memorable lines are next by Farhan:</i> <b>"Engineer ban ke frustrate ho jauga, fir jindagi
                bhar aapako kosuga, behetar ye hi hai na ki mai apne aap ko kosu. Kya hogaya mai aagr photographer
                ban jauga to kam paise kamuga, Ghar chota hoga, Gadi choti hogi, par Abba mai Khush rhuga! I would
                be very happy. Jo karuga dil se karuga! Maine aapki har ek baat suni hai, Aj bas ek bar muze meri
                dil ki baat sun ne dijiye please abba!”</b>

        </p>

        <p>
            You will need a lot of resistance to break the chain of convention &amp; do your own thing. Do things that
            you wouldn't normally do and overlook the obvious, and you won't regret it. Avoid having such
            statements– <b>“Kaash maine ye decision nhi liya hota!” &nbsp;</b>
        </p>

        <p>

            <b>
                You can be yourself and choose which path to take while being broke for a year. Or you can be
                someone
                else and never face yourself in the mirror.
            </b>

        </p>

        <h5>
            <p>Following the crowd and being like everybody else might be your choice if you want to be like
                everyone else. In contrast, if you want something unique and different, then choosing what you've
                always dreamed about is the right choice! Isn't the former an easier way to escape the herd
                than&nbsp;the&nbsp;latter?</p>
