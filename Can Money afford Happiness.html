        <h3>Can Money afford Happiness?</h3>



        <p>
            Hey guys! In this blog, I would like to talk about the significant connection between happiness and
            money. How many of you think that happiness cannot survive without money? Perhaps a few of the
            readers think money was never an essential factor for the existence of happiness, am I right? Yet, I
            would say in my opinion, Happiness and Money are two sides of our life without which it’s difficult to
            imagine our life. As we move toward modernization, money’s worth increases drastically in nature; You
            might have heard one key phrase in today's world <u><i>“Everything comes with a price!”</i></u>.



        </p>

        <div>
            <b>So, Can happiness also have a price tag?</b>
            <br>
            <b>Can we Buy Happiness with Money?</b>

            <p>When you look at the headline, don't these questions cross your mind? So let’s try answering these
                questions by simply noticing the general happenings in our surroundings in different environments…
            </p>

            <p>
                The basic question that arises throughout the topic would be <i><b>“CAN MONEY BUY HAPPINESS?”</b></i>
                The
                answer to this question will differ from person to person. If you ask those with excess money, they
                would say, "Yes, you can buy happiness with money". On the same note if you ask poverty-stricken
                people, they might behave as if money was never an issue in life, to begin with. It’s just you need to
                know how to be satisfied with what’s given. Their statements would be like - <i>
                    “Yeah sab moh Maya hai,
                    Paiso se khushiya nahi kharidi ja sakti… Khushiya pyaar se milti hai, Khushiya pariwar se milti hai…
                    and
                    so
                    on.”
                </i>
            </p>

            <p>
                <i><b>“Whoever said money can’t buy happiness simply didn’t know where to go shopping.”--Gertrude
                        stein</b></i>
            </p>

            <p>
                Exactly, people who say that money can’t buy happiness have apparently never used any! What is the
                point of lying about being satisfied, while struggling to earn money to fulfill the necessities of your
                family? Can you be happy if your child is hungry, or if you are in debt? Of course not! This proves that
                money and happiness are interconnected with each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nowadays, the time has radically changed - people’s average income has increased, and even ways to
                earn and spend money have amplified. As a result, we must learn today's generation's ways of earning
                and spending money. So that, we can live life to the fullest and use our well-earned money properly to
                accomplish our daily needs in every aspect of life.
            </p>

                <h6>Money is the solution for any materialistic issues -</h6>
                <p><i><u>Money can solve the different problems in your life…</u></i></p>
                <p>
                    For a commoner, what are the basic issues in everyday life?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If only we could buy a decent sized house in a pleasant area for the family. If only we could afford
                    a car
                    for daily transportation. If only I could get admission to a reputed college. If only I could have a
                    lump
                    sum amount of money to start my own business, and so on… That is, if we observe these situations
                    closely, the common problems of life are money-related. For instance, I want to buy a house; if I
                    have
                    the finances, I can buy a luxurious villa or bungalow at any location I prefer, such as the
                    seafront.
                    Regardless of how expensive a specialist's services are, I could have afforded to receive proper
                    treatment for any illness. If you have funds, you can establish your own business or you can study
                    at any
                    eminent institute. Overall, many of the problems in our life can be solved with money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>✔ Purpose of Wealth:</b>
                    It is common to experience momentary happiness when we think of having money, like being on
                    vacation, having an iPhone, paying for a BMW, etc. Moreover, if you explore the deepest
                    possibilities of
                    money, you will realize that money can give you all the ‘THINGS’ that can make you happy. The thing
                    is
                    money can help you achieve Freedom, Security, Healthy relationships, Better education, and a Bright
                    Future. If we summarize, <i>the basic purpose of Wealth is to improve our Living Standards.</i>
                </p>
                <p>Okay, to get a better grasp of my ideas, let us practice a simple simulation: Just imagine that you
                    are
                    having a luxurious life, you are wearing expensive clothes, your child is studying at renowned
                    universities, and you can daily have healthy meals four times a day. How do you feel now? Wow feels
                    good, right? Okay, now assume that you came into reality. You belong to a poor family, where a roof
                    and clothes are out of the question, since you cannot even afford two times the bread. Woof, quite
                    scary! Now, you ask yourself- “Which life would you prefer?”</p>

                <b><i>“Money can’t buy happiness but it can buy you the misery you prefer.” –Groucho Marx</i></b>
            </div>

            <p>
                <i><u>Money makes life easier;</u></i> In an easy life, it becomes easier to achieve a state of
                happiness. When you
                don't have to worry about your basic needs, then you can explore many different aspects of life like
                learning, reading, spirituality, and many more things which establishes peace in your subconscious mind
                by reducing the stress from your daily life. Maybe you wouldn’t have noticed it, <i><u>but money can
                        also give
                        us extra time.</u></i> Having extra time means we have time to improve ourselves by working on
                ourselves or
                to enjoy our hobbies.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>✔ Money aids to build a healthy mental system:</b>
                Even though you have paid the EMI for 5 years, you still need to pay more for the next 5 years to
                complete the full payment of your 3 BHK flat. Along with that, you have to pay your children's academic
                fees and their general expenses from your salary each month. Additionally, being in a joint family
                (which
                is common in Asian culture) you need to take care of your parents’ meditations and other medical or
                health-related equipment. Is it possible to have all this going on in your life and not feel stressed?
                What
                is the probability of that person enjoying his life? Are you sure that he/she is ok with not getting to
                spend some free time for himself/herself or his/her family and friends?
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead, having enough money in our pocket decreases most of the stress-threatening factors in our life.
                If money can solve most of the problems and can free us from a stress full life, we can assume that
                money does help us to be happy. Some people are struggling to earn enough to cover their daily
                expenses, while others are still stressing out about how they can earn a bigger amount of money or how
                they can expand their businesses to boost their income source, although they already have enough
                money. This is called being greedy. One should always feel grateful if one can afford a comfortable
                life. If
                it is challenging, think about those who can’t even afford a fan for the summer season, or how tough it
                could be to sleep on a mattress without having a blanket to resist the cold breezes in winter, or maybe
                the floating house in rainy days could do.

            </p>

            <p>
                <i><u>You can buy comfort with money.</u></i> Take an example of cars like BMW, Audi, and Rolls Royce,
                they charge
                you for comfort. Being comfortable could be less stressful.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i><u>Money gives you the steering of your life in your hands.</u></i> If you want to travel to another
                city urgently and
                if you have enough money, you can book a plane. Even if the plane isn't available for whatever reason,
                you can book a cab and you can arrive at the destination. <i><u> Money opens multiple doors for
                        you.</u></i>
            </p>

            <p>
                <i><b>“If money can’t buy happiness, then I guess I’ll have to rent it.”— <span
                            style="color: red">Unknown</span></b></i>
            </p>

            <div>
                <h6>Happiness is a state of mind, is it? </h6>

                <p>
                    <i><u>Money-related tension can fill a calm person with stress and despair.</u></i> That's why money
                    is necessary for
                    a stress-free and calm mind. In an interview, Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan once said- <b><i> “Don’t
                            become a
                            philosopher before you become rich!”.</i></b>
                </p>

                <p>As said, happiness is a state of mind. I agree - being happy is entirely up to you. But this state
                    comes only
                    after stability; stability of being employed or having a business, stability of having a proper
                    house to stay
                    in, stability of your children getting a proper education, and stability of fulfilling daily
                    necessities. For all
                    this, one should be “CAPABLE ENOUGH WITH MONEY” to bring themselves to a state of stability.</p>

                <p>
                    ✔ Diversity of Pleasure and Happiness:

                    So when you get an appraisal at work, or if your child has spoken his/her first word, or your
                    dearest
                    younger sister got her first salary, or you get the news that one of your closest friends is getting
                    married,
                    or maybe your elder brother is going to become a dad in a few months, how would you feel? Sounds
                    thrilling, right? This short-lived happiness is known as Momentary happiness. Momentary happiness is
                    an emotion of pleasure. Then, what is long-term happiness? The condition of sustained happiness
                    means the state of happiness. Like having healthy relationships, pursuing your dream career,
                    accomplishing the biggest goal in your life, or getting to learn about the reasons for your
                    existence, etc.
                    It is very important to analyze the difference between pleasure and happiness so that we can
                    understand what the limitations of pecuniary (monetary) happiness are.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Many people get confused between pleasure and happiness and think that both are the same. However,
                    pleasure is external and happiness is internal. Pleasure can be achieved with a substance while
                    happiness cannot be achieved with any substance. Happiness is different from pleasure in some ways,
                    even though it seems similar. Money can be of much help to those who are looking for pleasure but
                    there are some drawbacks to pleasure. Pleasure is time-limited. Pleasure often does not last long,
                    since
                    attention quickly moves to other matters. The feeling of being happy fades, when the individual is
                    unable to access the resource or the interest in the resource ends or their attention is
                    diverted. Sometimes, too much of something stops being enjoyable. That's why people who use money
                    for pleasure, at a certain point, think that money can't bring happiness. The extremes of pleasure
                    lead to
                    addiction, whether to a substance or behavior.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Money can bring you both happiness and pleasure at the same time, how? If you have money, society
                    will compliment you, respect you and give attention to you whereas when you don’t have any money,
                    your social value becomes NIL. They say people always salute the rising sun, and not the setting
                    one, but
                    how long will this pretentious respect and appreciation keep you happy??
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you spend on experiences, then experiences become part of your memories. Your memories of those
                    experiences make you happy whenever you recall them. So if you want your happiness to last for a
                    longer duration or period then fill your memory bank with such experiences, which will keep you
                    happy.
                    We do a huge mistake by buying/spending on those materialistic things like iPhones, expensive
                    clothes,
                    etc which give us momentary pleasure whereas we don't realize the importance of
                    experience. <i><u>Experiences make your life meaningful, while materialistic things give you
                            momentary
                            happiness.</u></i>
                </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h6>Money helps you to make others happy.</h6>

                <p>
                    <i><u>Money also helps you to make others smile.</u></i> If your child wants to buy toys or you want
                    to buy a gift for
                    your partner or parents, or even if you want to treat a beggar, everything requires money.
                    Therefore, in
                    order to keep your loved ones happy, to help the needy, or to do any sort of social work, you need
                    money. When the people involved are satisfied, you also get content. It is scientifically proven
                    that by
                    making others happy, you get some frequency waves generated in your brain due to which you get
                    satisfaction and achieve inner happiness. If you can’t believe it, try to help a needy poor person,
                    or
                    anyone. Nevertheless, you can only aid them when you have enough money. If your needs are higher
                    than your income then you won't be able to help others, and if anyhow you manage to help others then
                    you need to lower your desires which will lead to a decrease in self-happiness.

                </p>

                <small><i>In this case, both prerequisites are relevant: To give someone something, we need money (which
                        is a materialistic
                        act) and to give them a good life, we feel happy (therefore, it is a state of
                        mind)</i></small><br>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, most of life's materialistic problems can be solved by money.. Still, it is
                    ultimately up to us
                    to do what we can to make ourselves happy. Let's all do our very best to satisfy our desires and
                    bring
                    that stability to our lives. You do not need money to live a happy life, but instead of waiting for
                    the
                    "RIGHT" opportunity, you should always be open to learning and trying various things to adapt to the
                    current technological era. Instead of blaming money or forming the theory that money can't buy
                    happiness, think progressively, take actions, and develop a magnetic personality. This will attract
                    both
                    money and happiness to you. Rather than chasing happiness and money, you must develop your worth
                    so that you can incorporate everything into leading a happy life. So this was my point of view on
                    Can
                    money buy happiness? What’s your view? Let me know at my social media handle
