        <h3>Who decides what to live by? Why do people live by others' templates? Choosing unconventional ways of living
            might cause short-term discomfort, but following a template created by others would cause lasting
            discomfort.</h3>



        <p>
            This is one of my favorite dialogues & the scene from the 3 Idiots Movie:
        </p>

        <div>
            <p>When Pia & Rancho post a letter from Farhan to his favorite photographer as he wants to pursue Wildlife
                Photography and
            </p>

            <p>Farhan says – <b>“Abba nahi Manage!”</b></p>
            <p>
                Rancho replies – <b>“ Aaj dar mat Farhan, Jab tu budha hokar aayse hi kisi Haspatal me pada hoga aur
                    marne ka intezar kar raha hoga, Tab sochega ki letter hath me tha, Taxi gate par thi, Thodi si
                    Himmat kar leta to Jindagi kuch aur hoti. ”
                </b>

            </p>

            <p>
                Most of us have experienced this situation while we are making choices about our careers, marriage, etc.
                Society has developed a template for you –
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
                    Just like things you need to accomplish in your 20’s – Complete education, Get a decent Job, Get
                    Married, Buy a House, Have kids, and whatnot….

                </b>
            </p>

            <p>Walking on your own path could be uncomfortable and frightening.</p>
            <p><b><i>Guess what’s more scary?</i></b></p>
            <p>
                What’s even scarier is to walk on the path that everyone walks on <b><i>(The Rat Race)</i></b>; only to
                realize later
                that you wouldn’t have chosen that path.

            </p>

            <p>When Farhan goes to his father and tell him – <b>“ Abba mai Engineer nahi Ban na Chahta, muze wildlife
                    photographer ban na hai” </b>
            </p>

            <p>What his father replies is – <b>“Kitna kama loge us jungle me, 5 saal bad jab aapne dosto ko badi badi
                    gadio me ghumte dekhoge to kosoge khud ko, are hasege log…” </b>
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>The most memorable lines are next by Farhan:</i> <b>"Engineer ban ke frustrate ho jauga, fir jindagi
                    bhar aapako kosuga, behetar ye hi hai na ki mai apne aap ko kosu. Kya hogaya mai aagr photographer
                    ban jauga to kam paise kamuga, Ghar chota hoga, Gadi choti hogi, par Abba mai Khush rhuga! I would
                    be very happy. Jo karuga dil se karuga! Maine aapki har ek baat suni hai, Aj bas ek bar muze meri
                    dil ki baat sun ne dijiye please abba!”</b>

            </p>

            <p>
                You will need a lot of resistance to break the chain of convention & do your own thing. Do things that
                you wouldn't normally do and overlook the obvious, and you won't regret it. Avoid having such
                statements– <b>“Kaash maine ye decision nhi liya hota!”  </b>
            </p>

            <p>

                <b>
                    You can be yourself and choose which path to take while being broke for a year. Or you can be
                    someone
                    else and never face yourself in the mirror.
                </b>

            </p>

            <h5>
                <p>Following the crowd and being like everybody else might be your choice if you want to be like
                    everyone else. In contrast, if you want something unique and different, then choosing what you've
                    always dreamed about is the right choice! Isn't the former an easier way to escape the herd
                    than the latter?</p>
            </h5>
