    <h3>The 3 Habits: “Foundation of Success”</h3>

    <!-- <p>This was a project I started back in november 2017 when I first learned python. I was the sole creator/developer for the first year of the project before I was able to hire help.
		<br>
		<br>
		The system stored fuel sample data for the entire lab and provided an interface for lab chemists and admins to view, add and send data to clients.
		<br>
		<br>
		Lab results would be generated by the system in PDF form and automatically sent to the client along with an interface for customers to be able to login and view.
		<br>
		<br>
		Customers had the ability to view all their data with a dynamic search form, trend data, add notes to reports and even map their samples' physical location.
		<br>
		<br>
		I worked on this system for 2 years before selling this to FOI Laboratories.</p> -->

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Learn to sell:</b> The phrase anticipates how to sell yourself. Oh!
        What I just said would sound disgusting, but it’s a fact. To be more
        precise, you need to sell (demonstrate) your skills to the interviewer
        if you want to earn the job. You have to sell your products to as many
        clients as you can to raise your profit. That means, to gain
        something, you need to sell something which belongs to you; it can be
        your skills, your work, your products, etc.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Choose Wisely:</b> You have to choose wisely what is good and what
        is bad for you. You should know how to figure out which steps would
        take you closer to your goals. In addition, look around your friend
        circle where you frequently spend time. Spend your time with level-up
        people. Spending your day with similar level people can never help you
        to improve. In fact, even if you try to grow in such surroundings,
        there is a probability that you will get dragged down by those people.
        In such cases, you will get to hear a phrases like “chodna yaar ye sab
        kya kar raha hai chill kartein hai”. Being closed to well-experienced
        people encourages you to learn more and explore your knowledge in a
        proper place. In short, I would like to shed some light on this famous
        quote, “If you are the smartest guy in the room, then you are in the
        wrong room”. This means you won’t be learning anything new when you
        are the only smartest in the room.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Sow the seeds of multiple income streams:</b> To become financially
        independent and wealthy simultaneously, you need to work for various
        income streams. You can’t be affluent by a single source of income.
        For example, you can start a side hustle, a small business, or you can
        do stock trading; invest in real estate apart from your job.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The habit that I practice a lot is “Positive Affirmations”. What is a positive affirmation? Basically, initiating
      or finishing your day by saying something good to yourself is positive affirmations. You would have seen lots of
      people talking with their image in a mirror and telling themselves that you’re awesome, you are great! And other
      pleasant phrases to themselves. This concept works and trains your mind to think that you are good enough or
      capable to achieve whatever you aspire. Now the most important thing for everybody is confidence. The moment you
      lose confidence, all three habits will be affected negatively. So positive affirmation is the best way to grow
      your confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Secondly, you need to understand that Life is Hard. Okay, sometimes life can be very hard, hundered’s of bouncers
      will come your way. Then we can do two things – Either we get hit by a bouncer, sit back and cry, blame ourselves,
      other people or we can come back like Virat Kohli, put the helmet on, come back and hit a century. So either we
      can cry, or we can find the solution. When you get this kind of attitude, you get more confident. Who's gonna stop
      you from becoming successful? Nobody, but you.</p>
    </p>
    <p>And lastly, I would like to say imagine yourself in the next 5 years, Where do you see yourself in the next 5
      Years? What are your goals for the next 5 years? Just keep working for those goals and give your best. Think that
      I want to be in that position in the next five years. Even if you can't reach the goal don’t be disappointd
      because at least you have tried your best; so love the procedure and keep trying with determination. Just remember
      that whenever you face failure you get to learn new things from your mistakes. Learn from your mistakes. Things
      can go wrong, screw it and instead of crying try to find solution.</p>
    <p>And I would like to conclude by <i>“To baat aaysi hai ki, Har Jeet to Parinam hai, Par koshish krna to, humara kaam
      hai”</i></p>
